	DATASET EXPLAINATIONS

The KR dataset (Kids Recode) contains information on children and their mothers, including variables related to child health, nutrition, and demographic characteristics. 

The Hr dataset (Household Recode) includes household-level data such as household characteristics, education, wealth index, and living conditions.

To create a single analytical dataset, the two files were merged using common identifiers usually cluster number, household number, and respondent’s line number allowing the child-level records from the KR dataset to be matched with corresponding household information from the PR dataset.
